# natural-image-OCR-using-EAST
This python program uses EAST text detector and Tesseract OCR engine to recognize text in any natural image and output the result into a text file. I made the output a text file because I personally used it to be the input to a text-to-speech module. <br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> to run this program you should download frozen_east_text_detection.pb and place it in the same folder.
